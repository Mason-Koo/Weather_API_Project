Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App – a simple yet powerful weather forecasting tool! This app fetches real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents them in a clean and user-friendly interface built with Python and PyQt5.

It’s as easy as typing a city name and getting the current temperature, weather conditions, and an emoji that perfectly describes the weather. 🌦️
